# Development log for this custom build version of bookshelf. 

## 2020-11-01

created the initial project. 

first objective is to setup a gulp build pipeline for all the nonsense. 
does it help to have a static assets folder outside the src structure? 

we would just copy it directly, right?
more or less, we could always do some extra transformation on the static assets folder

use es2015 modules.
