<h1 id="rules-to-break">Rules to Break</h1>
<h2 id="throwing-down">Throwing Down</h2>
<p>Fire fights in dark alleys, monosword duels on abandoned factory crane towers, wrestling matches in combat-rated cyberbodies. This section covers various topics that might come up during conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="the-initiative-relay">The Initiative Relay</h3>
<p>The Boosted Reflexes upgrade mentions that you can do something called steal the initiative. Here's what that means.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A conflict starts with the most appropriate character. Commonly: the first one who decides to make it a fight, the one with the most wired reflexes, or the one with the highest Notice skill.</li>
  <li>After a character has acted they pass the initiative to any character who hasn't gone yet, even a foe.</li>
  <li>The last character to act chooses any character in the conflict to go first in the next the round.</li>
  <li>If you haven't gone yet you can invoke an appropriate aspect to steal the initiative from someone who hasn't rolled yet. Characters that lose the initiative doesn't lose their action, but you do get to see some evidence of what they intended to do and who they intended to target before you interrupt them. You can steal the first action of the round even if you've been ambushed. Once they get the initiative again, they get to choose a different action.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="initiative-relay-and-gear-with-effect-skills">Initiative Relay and Gear with Effect Skills</h4>
<p>Gear with effect skills such as grenades and drugs rely on your <span class="fate-icon">overcome</span> action for effective deliver but afterwards can act on their own. When you activate devices like this insert them into the pool of characters who have not acted. You may pass device the initiative so it goes immediately after you, but fast acting foes may still use an aspect to steal the initiative away from your device.</p>
<h3 id="ammunition">Ammunition</h3>
<h3 id="guns">Guns</h3>
<h3 id="stress--consequences">Stress &#x26; Consequences</h3>
<p>Fighting on the edge is swift and violent. Though firearms are still the most common weapons you will face, advances in material science have made them more deadly than ever and characters who aren't equipped for combat can find themselves dead faster than their plain old meat brain can register the danger.</p>
<p>Characters in Ghosting the Edge start with 2 physical stress and 2 mental stress as normal, but Physique and Will do not provide any additional stress boxes or consequence slots. Augmentation stunts can give a character additional physical stress boxes.</p>
<article class="right">
  <h4 id="optional-ruleultra-deadly">Optional Rule​—Ultra Deadly</h4>
  <p>If you want to emphasis this even more, reduce initial stress boxes to 1, or even 0. This will make armor and augmentations even more valuable.</p>
</article>
<h4 id="conceding">Conceding</h4>
<p>When coming up with concessions for character remember that death is just a temporary condition if you have enough money or connections. Sure, you might die for a while, but if your brain is relatively intact, or if even your memories are stored somewhere else, it can be possible to "reconstruct" a character. Of course, that might only be possible if you make a Faustian bargain with some corporation, but even death can be overcome with enough money.</p>
<h3 id="range">Range</h3>
<p>Zones are an intentionally abstract measure of distance. Weapons may have impressive ranges over which they remain effective, but the truth is your attack depends more on your skill then on the effective range of your weapon.</p>
<h4 id="grappling">Grappling</h4>
<p>You and your foe are in intense physical contact. You need to establish a <span class="aspect">Grappled</span> aspect to achieve this level of range because it renders most weapons and a good many kinds of attacks ineffective. Or at least, increases their difficulty. Grappled characters can't succeed with most attacks unless they can <span class="fate-icon">overcome</span> their <span class="aspect">Grappled</span> aspect.</p>
<h4 id="close-quarters-combat-cqc">Close Quarters Combat (CQC)</h4>
<p>Means you are within the same zone.</p>
<h4 id="near">Near</h4>
<p>Adjacent zones.</p>
<h4 id="far">Far</h4>
<p>Separated by 1 to 3 zones. The default range of most small arms.</p>
<h4 id="farther">Farther</h4>
<p>Separated by more than 3 zones.</p>
<h3 id="assassination">Assassination</h3>
<p>Assassination is not a conflict. A conflict requires two parties who can act to hurt each other, and if your target is fighting back it's not an assassination anymore.</p>
<p>Treat an assassination as a skill challenge, commonly with a Shoot O for the actual kill and other skills for planning and escaping.</p>
<p>Same thing goes even if you are sniping a group of targets who are actively taking cover to avoid you. It's not a conflict if they can't attack you back. They can <span class="aspect">Take Cover</span> and setup obstacles to your sniping or <span class="fate-icon">overcome</span> your <span class="aspect">Concealment</span> to find you and target you with their own attacks, assuming their weapons have sufficient range.</p>
<h4 id="setting-difficulty">Setting Difficulty</h4>
<p>Sniping​—A kill shot on a typical human under average conditions takes a good shot so start with +3 opposition and increase as circumstances warrant.</p>
<p>Other forms of assassination, such as poisoning, will vary in difficulty depending on the paranoia and training of the target. If it needs to look like an accident that can be even more complicated.</p>
<h3 id="scale--effectiveness">Scale &#x26; Effectiveness</h3>
<p>Some things are large and thickly armored, like an Extermine-8 Battle Tank and some things are small; like the caliber of the Saturday night special you found in your uncle's old shoe box. There will be times when you need a bigger gun or a smarter plan. If there's agreement about a particular attack being either effective or ineffective, such as a knife against an unenhanced person, a pocket pistol vs. a battle tank, or natural venoms against a cybernetic body, then the attack either works or, it won't work no matter what you roll. If there is doubt about whether something would work, you can require the application of another skill to make the attack plausible. For example, your uncle's old .38 might not be able to penetrate a suit of Assault Armor, but if you can identify a weak joint to aim for, your attack can be effective. This sounds like <span class="fate-icon">create</span> but it works better as an Overcome because without changing the situation you wouldn't be effective at all. You can think if it as rolling to overcome an advantage your foe already has.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>Congrats! You finally made it to the hacking section. I hope a bunch of you skipped straight here. This section starts with background material about the things hackers do, what they do to them to, and the tools they use to do it. Then you'll find rules for two ways to resolve hacking attempts: as an action, or as a scene.</p>
<p>For a hacker, everything here is common knowledge, but this is far from everything you'll run into. There are other things out there beyond the keen of your work-a-day hacker. Half-crazed Frankenstein IC lurking in forgotten servers, rogue AI who capture hackers and try to "debug" their minds, and rumors of ghost hacks that can rewrite your soul.</p>
<article class="left">
  <h4 id="hacking-terms">Hacking Terms</h4>
  <p>
    Hack
    ~ A general term for the act of performing unauthorized operations with computers or other electronics. Also a general term for a specific instance of hacking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Crack
    ~ To bypass a barrier program and gain unauthorized access to a system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exploit
    ~ A program or other hack, to make a syst.em do what you want it to do, especially if that's something the system has safeguards in place to prevent. Such as making a factorybot weld someone's face.
  </p>
  <p>
    System
    ~ An entity which can be interfaced with.
  </p>
  <p>
    Node
    ~ It can be a computer, a smart device, or even a brain.
  </p>
  <p>Most systems can contain data and many have skills they can perform, some of which can affect the physical world. A robot, for example, can be a system.</p>
  <p>If you permanently link one system to another in network we generally refer to those systems as nodes.</p>

<aside class="quoted right">
  <p>For most people the interface is their whole life. Tells them where to be and who they know. It's like a having a magic wand you can wave and your house will come alive and clean itself and make you a cup of coffee. But, these people are not hackers. They only use 20% of what an interface is capable of. Hackers push it all the way to 110% percent. We have to. When we're on a run we're up against programs that can fry your brain faster than you can think 'oh shit!'</p>
  <footer>Betty Talent</footer>
</aside>
<h3 id="the-interface-and-you">The Interface and You</h3>
<p>The interface is what makes hacking, as we know it today, possible. Sure there are other ways to it. Slow ways. And slow is dead for you and everyone counting on you. But, even with an interface there are difficulties to be considered.</p>
<h4 id="unlocking-your-interface">Unlocking your Interface</h4>
<p>A wireless interface implant can let you hack a secure net in Moscow while you're driving a car in Tokyo but the companies that manufacture them don't want you doing that sort of thing, which is why commercial interfaces are really highly restricted tools of social control.</p>
<p>With a <span class="aspect">Commercial Interface</span> there are places in the Net you cannot visit. They are filtered out of your perception. There are things you cannot do, like share your thoughts with another person, and nothing you can do is anonymous. Your identity is embedded in your interface so that every place your go in the Net, every secure net you connect to, everything you buy, everything you eat, and everything you throw out are all recorded and linked to your identity. The <span class="aspect">Really Cheap Commercial Interfaces</span> even allow a constant stream of advertisements to whisper in your ear like a demon on your shoulder. Some interfaces even have special protocols corps can use to temporarily deactivate your brain if you get caught hacking. Go read your terms and conditions if you don't believe me.</p>
<p>People accept this intrusion because they don't intend to do any hacking with their interface anyway, and most of the tracking data is just used to sell them things and improve the quality of their services. Imagine that twice in row you order a pizza after an evening work out, but the third time your interface asks if you'd like it to order the pizza for you every time you work out after 6 pm? They also accept it because they need their interface to do their job. Their corp job which is the only thing standing between them and moving into the district.</p>
<p>Anyway, this all means that the first thing you need to be a hacker is an <span class="aspect">Unlocked Interface</span>. One that you have complete control over. You can block ads, and turn off any perception filtering in the Net so you can visit all those nasty hacker hangouts the corp overloads didn't want you to know existed. And what's even better is you have control over the identity of your interface. You can mask it, which will get you rejected from most commercial systems. Or you can present a fake identity, hackers buy them by the dozen. Or you can spoof somebody else's id and get them fingered for your hacker crimes. Of course, most secure nets will raise an alert if a duplicate id connects and lock you both down until the situation can be sorted out. Which is, in fact, a common hacker prank called <span class="aspect">Deduping</span>.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're lucky enough to have a high level job as say, a corp hacker, you can get an <span class="aspect">Unrestricted Interface</span>, which still tracks you, but which doesn't filter you.</p>
<p>You can unlock one yourself by using Tech, or pay someone you trust to do it for you.</p>
<h4 id="barriers">Barriers</h4>
<p>The second thing any good hacker does is upgrade the barrier on their interface. Corp hackers have access to sophisticated attack barrier programs and even combat IC programs, but most hackers prefer to write their own barrier programs.</p>
<h4 id="hardening">Hardening</h4>
<p>Your interface has a rating it can use to passively resist hacking attempts if you happen to be asleep, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated. Most of the time, you'll roll active opposition with your Hack skill.</p>
<h4 id="hands-free-hacking">Hands Free Hacking</h4>
<p>The best part about interface implants these days is the wireless part. You don't need to plug a cord into the back of your neck and go find someplace to "jack in." You are always connected to the big Net and every little net you pass by.</p>
<p>Some of the cheaper commercial interface implants have <span class="aspect">Weak Wireless Radio</span> which can be a hindrance, but you can always connect to a signal booster. In fact, most cars have signal boosters you can plug into, or built in to compensate for degradation at high speeds. If you are going to hack from your car, don't forget to mask your signal booster id.</p>
<h5 id="promiscuous-mode">Promiscuous Mode</h5>
<p>This is the default mode for most interface implants and it means they'll automatically connect and share information with whatever secure net or device comes into range.</p>
<aside class="right">
  <p>which's how Mode-Little-En hacked JelRazor; by sticking a magnetic wireless repeater on Jel's <span class="aspect">Direct Contact Plate</span> and frying his brain.</p>
</aside>
<h5 id="isolation-mode">Isolation Mode</h5>
<p>Turning off your wireless means you can only hack or be hacked by systems you are physically linked to. This can include direct contact plates.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-fighting-in-the-net">But what about fighting in the Net?</h3>
<p>You got me. Fight, and Move, but especially Physique, don't work the same in the Net as they do in the real world…Or do they? An interface is wired to the motor centers of your brain just like it is to your sensory centers, so, it's reasonable to say someone's fighting and athletic skills could transfer to the Net. Maybe they transfer, but are limited to being no higher than your Hack rating.</p>
<h3 id="oh-the-places-you-will-go">Oh the Places You Will Go</h3>
<p>Now you know what to do. Here's an intro to the various systems you can do them to, or in.</p>
<h4 id="systems">Systems</h4>
<p>Any hackable thing is a system. It's something that you can interface with, something you can exploit. This includes human brains with interface implants.</p>
<p>Every system has a Hardening rating which represents how strongly that system resists hackers attempting to execute unauthorized operations.</p>
<h5 id="locales">Locales</h5>
<p>Every system can contain nearly infinite cyberspace. In fact, every system can contain a sizable number of nearly infinite cyber worlds in the form of constructs, and large programs, and we refer to each of the interesting places for you to visit as a locale. A locale is just like any other physical place you might visit. Abstractly it's a collection of contiguous zones which you can move around in using virtual "physical" movements. A program can have a number of locales too. In general locales are interesting to cyberspace tourists, but hackers could careless, because to them, every locale is just code. They see beyond the virtualized world and can access the programs creating the illusions of reality that a locale is, and they can rewrite it.</p>
<p>Speaking of movement in systems, the system will determine which "physical" movement modalities will be available to you. Some systems might support only basic walking, others have fully realized vehicles for you to use, and quite a few support the wish fulfillment modality of unaided human flight.</p>
<p>So, you can move around the zones of a Locale using whatever is available on that system, but generally you don't have to, because every system will present you the ability to navigate with just a thought. If a system has more than one interesting Locale available, then it will give you a file system like menu to allow you jump from locale to locale.</p>
<p>A locale can be a construct, or a representation of a program, or just a reproduction of the corp building the system is installed in. the point is that Locales tend to implement the same rules as physical reality, but they don't have to, and most importantly, if you are a hacker then you were born to break any rules the systems try to lay down on you.</p>
<h4 id="nodes">Nodes</h4>
<p>A system can be linked to other systems to create a network. We refer to each system in a network as a node.</p>
<p>A node doesn't have correspond to a physical device. Many corp nets are constructed of a multitude of nodes, each with a distinct responsibility and with a variety of virtual and physical links between them. Many systems have layers of security. The nodes closest to the public and the Net are easy to hack, but to exploit the really good stuff, you need to crack several layers of increasingly secure nodes to get to the core.</p>
<h4 id="links">Links</h4>
<p>The links between nodes can be quite diverse, from a bundle of nanowire to an ultrasonic link between the hacked speakers on one computer and the hacked microphone on another. Links can be conditional or transitory as well, like a satellite downlink that radios data to a ground receiver once a day. That's a one way link which is only available for a short time.</p>
<p>Many systems can link, and be linked too, via wireless radio signals and most use wireless to link to the global Net and through that, billions of other systems.</p>
<h4 id="hardening-1">Hardening</h4>
<p>Some systems are more difficult to hack then others. Hardening is a general rating of a systems resistance to hacking and the qualities of its intrusion detection. It can be passive or active opposition depending on the other qualities of the system, or other characters in the system can use their own Hack skills in place of the system's hardening.</p>
<h4 id="barriers-1">Barriers</h4>
<p>Barriers are defensive programs that protect a system, or a locale, from unauthorized entry. Barriers commonly restrict access to a list of pre-authorized interface identities. Which means you have wireless access to your car's secure net, and any friends you want to add, but some random pedestrian does not.</p>
<p>Barriers can be programmed to allow access in other ways, like old fashioned usernames and passwords, some secret passphrase, or even through certain shared human memories that can be analyzed by the barrier program. Some barriers are maze barriers which anyone could get through given enough time</p>
<p>If you succeed in cracking a barrier program then no one will be the wiser and the system will accept you as an authorized user until you fail some other hacking action. However, many barriers are programmed to react to failed intrusion attempts with varying degrees of hostility. There's Flytrap barriers which trap hackers and prevent them from logging out or moving at all. There's sophisticated Honeypot barriers which trick you into thinking you cracked them by shunting you into a dummy version of the system tracing exactly what you try do. And, of course, there's the ubiquitous attack barrier which inflicts its rating in stress on any hacker who failed or ties when trying to <span class="fate-icon">overcome</span> it.</p>
<h5 id="attack-barriers">Attack Barriers</h5>
<p>A ubiquitous form of defense for many high security systems, an attack barrier is something like an electrified wall. Any hacker who rolls to overcome an attack barrier but fails takes a hit equal to the opposition of the attack barrier. If the he ties he still takes the hit but if he survives, he's past the barrier. Once you hack a barrier it stays hacked, meaning you don't have to overcome it again, until someone else rolls to close the hole you discovered. (or created).</p>
<p>Attack barriers make survival as a hacker an exercise in good judgment. Attack barriers don't necessarily advertise how dangerous they are. In fact, when diving a strange system, you won't know if there is an attack barrier or not.</p>
<p>Typical commercial attack barriers are rated 2. Serious barriers, ones use for Corp and Mil systems, are usually rated at least 3 and sometimes far higher.</p>
<p>Given a peak Hack skill of 4, most commercial stuff is easy, it has a Barrier of 1 to 3. Lesser secure nets of corps and people who care about their privacy have Barriers of 4 to 6. Most major corp nets have barriers of at least 5, and you'll find yourself actively opposed.</p>
<p>Most good hackers program their own barriers, or use corp/military grade ones. Given time, characters can create a barrier equal to their rating as a Hacker. In a pinch a hacker can roll create advantage to give a system's native barrier temporary reinforcement.</p>
<p>All cyberbrains and Interface implants have attack barriers and nearly all secure nets do as well. Brains protected by barriers can willingly turn them off, or allow select targets through.</p>
<p>Attack barriers also have turn-off codes, which will be known to some human somewhere.</p>
<h5 id="maze-barriers">Maze Barriers</h5>
<p>A less dangerous form of barrier is the maze barrier. Creating these is a common exercise for student programmers. They are not inherently dangerous, instead they rely on confusing and misdirecting a hacker through an endless virtual maze hoping that they will give up before they find their way through. There is always a way through the maze, otherwise the secure net on the other side wouldn't be able to send and receive information. As such they don't usually have a passcode like an attack barrier, rather those who know the secret can pass the maze quickly, while those who don't have to spend a lot of time guessing.</p>
<p>By themselves, maze barriers are not terribly secure, but when they are used, they are commonly filled with IC.</p>
<h4 id="intrusion-countermeasures-ic">Intrusion Countermeasures (IC)</h4>
<p>Intrusion Countermeasures, unlike static barriers, are free roaming security programs designed to do various things from capture to kill unidentified hackers in a system. Common IC comes in a variety of shades: Green, Red, Grey, and Black depending on what they do.</p>
<h5 id="green-ic">Green IC​</h5>
<aside class="left">
  <p><em>aka</em> tracers, shadows, ghosts, spooks, ninjas</p>
</aside>
<p>Green IC is harmless on its own. When they detect and intruder they follow it around and trace where it goes and what it does and reports that back to its central authority.</p>
<h5 id="red-ic">Red IC</h5>
<aside class="right">
  <p><em>aka</em> rushers, come-ons, flashers, distract-o-bots, honeypots</p>
</aside>
<p>Red IC re less common forms of IC. They are designed to distract intruders. Often by flooding their brains with sensory overloads of, say, pleasure.</p>
<h5 id="grey-ic">Grey IC</h5>
<aside class="left">
  <p><em>aka</em> glue, chains, cages</p>
</aside>
<p>Grey IC captures intruders until someone can come along and decide what to do with them.</p>
<h5 id="black-ic">Black IC</h5>
<aside class="right">
  <p><em>aka</em> killers, burners, black knights</p>
</aside>
<p>Black IC programs are the enforcers of a system. They are designed to attack and kill the brains of intruders.</p>
<p>IC programs can be obstacles to overcome, or treated as NPCs with their own skills, aspects, and sometimes stunts.</p>
<p>They are usually used only in secure nets though some hackers secure their own servers with custom IC.</p>
<p>Note that these four types of IC are only the most commonly encountered, and heavy duty IC is usually a blend of multiple types.</p>
<h4 id="secure-nets">Secure nets</h4>
<p>Any network with a barrier program can be called a secure net. An unsecure or open net would be a network without a barrier program.</p>
<h4 id="the-net">The Net</h4>
<p>Some people think its Heaven. Some people say it's where the demons come from. It's not an electronic reproduction of the physical world, in fact, the Net contains multiple reproductions and reconstructions of the real world, of historical periods, and of every fictional world ever created.</p>
<h4 id="constructs">Constructs</h4>
<p>Most nets are mostly visual information, but interface implants are capable of so much more. Constructs are new worlds completely detailed for all the senses and programmed to be interactive. Constructs can be games, spas, amusement park attractions, personal fiefdoms, or research projects attempting to accurately model the real world. They can be a single room, or even just a richly detailed object like a reproduction of a famous painting. Or, they can be as large as the world and contain reproductions of any historical period you'd care to visit.</p>
<p>Constructs can be almost indistinguishable from the real world, but they don't have to be. They can have radically different physics, contain impossible creatures, and be whatever they are built to be, and sometimes more then you expected.</p>
<p>Once you enter a construct you are subject to its programmed version of reality. Mostly. You can take actions and interact with things using your normal skills. Notice, Fight, Move, Friend, etc… They might act differently in the construct, but real life is the general rule. You can also use Hack to bend the rules by creating things or changing them, or enhancing yourself with extra aspects. You can tweak a construct, but you can't make system wide rewrites unless you deal enough stress to the construct to crash it.</p>
<p>Most constructs are designed to allow you freely leave whenever want, but some are traps which will use their hardening to roll active opposition against any attempts to leave or log out.</p>
<h4 id="persona">Persona</h4>
<p>Like a construct, a persona is a fully detailed and interactive entity that lives in cyberspace, but it's the representative of a person rather than a place.</p>
<h3 id="oh-the-things-you-will-do">Oh the Things You Will Do</h3>
<article class="left">
  <h4 id="12-things-you-can-do-with-a-hack-skill">12 things you can do with a hack skill</h4>
  <p>Now you know a bit about the tools of your trade. Here's list of things you can do with your Hack skill.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Crack a secure net. I.e., get past the system barrier so you can run an exploit on the system.</li>
    <li>Code a program to do something, like conceal your presence in the net, or duplicate your signal to interfere with a system's defensive programs. Maybe escalate your access so you crack the next layer of system. Or create a weapon that will help you deal with some nasty IC. Or a net to lock it down long enough for you to log out. Or create an IC program to monitor your home net. Or create a virus that will create false memories or sensations in someone with an interface. Write a barrier program.</li>
    <li>Deal stress to the system you're interfaced with to try to take it down.</li>
    <li>Deal stress to another interfaced hacker, program, or net construct.</li>
    <li>Exploit the system to make it do what you want. Cause a smartgun's targeting software to suggest shooting who you want, or cause a building's fire suppression system to activate, or cause a total security lockdown, hack some data and make it look like it was always that way.</li>
    <li>Try to disconnect, this is an action because it can opposed. There are some programs created specifically to keep you from escaping.</li>
    <li>Cover your tracks, remove or cover up the traces of your activity in a secure net.</li>
    <li>Monitor a system for other hacker activity and oppose it.</li>
    <li>Build and secure a net or other net construct.</li>
    <li>Defend against actions by hackers, programs, AI, and other net constructs</li>
    <li>Trace an interface signal, or other hacking action, back to its device of origin and possibly even its geographic location.</li>
    <li>Analyze the source. Look at the guts of an exploit or program to learn more about who wrote it. Think of it like an antique, you can learn how skilled the hacker was. Based on what it is and how it's constructed you can learn things about where it came from. If it's a commercial program, or the hacker was lazy and used bits from a commercial program, that can be identified which gives you a company and a lead, and sometimes you can even find the hacker equivalent of a maker's mark.</li>
  </ol>
</article>
<h4 id="detection-tracing-and-getting-traced">Detection, Tracing and Getting Traced</h4>
<p>Hacking is essentially an illicit activity and a successful hack is almost always the one that goes undetected. You don't use your Stealth skill to sneak around the Net. You use your Hack skill to make you and whatever you are doing look totally legitimate. Systems don't have a Notice skill, they have intrusion detection. Either the system thinks you are legit or it thinks you are a hacker and it's assumed that you are covering your tracks and that a successful hack goes unnoticed, at least until you've left that net. Of course, failed hacking attempts, or the cost part of succeeding at cost, will very often mean your unauthorized activity has been flagged as such by the system and you are now a detected threat. Getting detected doesn't mean your hack is over. You can keep on trying to crack that barrier or run your exploit, but the system will be taking active countermeasures against you.</p>
<h4 id="programs">Programs</h4>
<p>When hackers aren't out cracking secure nets and subverting smart devices, they spend a lot of time writing programs.</p>
<p>Lots of programs are practical and boring, but hackers also write other kinds of programs too and this is a section about those programs.</p>
<p>Most of these will be oneoff programs that you'll run and delete because they are really just a side effect of your Hack actions. For example, you might write a quick <span class="aspect">BFG Program</span> to give you an edge in fighting another hacker in the Net. Or you might whip up a <span class="aspect">Cloak of Invisibility</span> to make it easier to remain undetected during your run.</p>
<p>Some programs are more detailed and autonomous. They have skills of their own and sometimes persona. IC programs are commonly of this sort.</p>
<h5 id="hacks--exploits">Hacks &#x26; Exploits</h5>
<p>Any exploit you run on a system, in fact, just about any action you take with your Hack skill is technically a program. They are disposable bits of code your write to fit your exact circumstances and only ever run once. These bits of code are important because they can be analyzed like any program. Successful hackers make a point of removing all the traces of their actions when they can. But, sometimes your get jacked by slick prototype IC and you have to leave some traces behind.</p>
<h5 id="scripts">Scripts</h5>
<p>Scripts are great! They're like an entire hacking montage you can store and run whenever want. You can make a good living writing scripts for people who don't know how to hack; to help them destroy evidence of their crimes, or to commit them. A script can be programmed to do whatever tasks you need it too, but only those tasks and only against the system you wrote it for, and even then, only for as long as their defenses remain more or less the same.</p>
<p>Creating a script is like planning a heist and giving the instructions to a robot to run and the robot can only be as smart as you you're your script. Because you have to account for everything up front, it helps to have some foreknowledge about the security of the net you are targeting. From, for example, <span class="aspect">Insider Information</span>, or based on your own recent experience.</p>
<p>To create a script, either roll a Hacking montage against the target system right now, or wait until the script is actually run and then roll. Whichever fits the flow of your game better.</p>
<p>The opposition for a script is the same as a normal montage except with the chance for additional complications that can increase the difficulty. Things like having to do a rush job on the script, or having no idea what the defenses of the system are like, can markedly increase your opposition.</p>
<p>The consequences of a failed script are less immediate then a direct hacking action but not necessarily less severe. A script has to be run from somewhere, and if it fails, the system you're attacking can trace the source back to whatever device ran it. Even if you, or the angry guy you sold the script to, manages to bury that trail, a good forensic hacker can learn a lot by analyzing your script.</p>
<h5 id="barriers-2">Barriers</h5>
<p>Given sufficient time you can create a barrier program rated equal to your Hack skill. In a pinch choose a barrier rating and add 2 to your opposition for the rush.</p>
<p>Advanced barriers, like attack barriers, take extra time, and add 2 to the opposition to be created.</p>
<p>If you're defending a system from being cracked, you can roll active opposition using the Barrier rating, or your Hack skill. This will replace the system's normal passive opposition though. You risk inadvertently making the system more vulnerable by rolling poorly.</p>
<p>Alternately, if you have the time to prepare you can use a <span class="fate-icon">create</span> action to make your system's barrier more difficult to crack. You can use your invokes to add to the barrier's passive opposition.</p>
<h5 id="ic">IC</h5>
<p>Intrusion Countermeasures are a class of autonomous programs designed to detect and stop hackers. They can move on their own.</p>
<h5 id="viruses">Viruses</h5>
<p>Malicious programs designed to do some manner of harm to a system or a person and usually to be pretty sneaky about it.</p>
<h4 id="ghost-hacking">Ghost hacking</h4>
<p>The interface implant allows you to quite literally make your mind one with machines, which is indispensable if you want any worthwhile corp job. There is a consequence to this that's often ignored; now your brain can be hacked just like a computer.</p>
<p>Most ghost hacks are just urban legends because the reality of hacking human minds is that it's very difficult. The interface implant is connected to the most malleable or all organs and it's wired by programmable machines who have to make tests and intelligence decisions about which is the right neurons to wire up. Not to mention the many generations of interface implants and the hundreds of different models of interface devices.</p>
<p>Memory</p>
<p>The potential is definitely there and is hugely frightening. A ghost hack could erase selected memories, of your loved ones, or defining events in your life, and the worst part is, how would you if this happened to you? Do you have a backup of your brain? Memories can be erased, or they can be changed. Are you afraid of spiders? Where you always that way? What if the event in your past that made you afraid of spiders wasn't real?</p>
<p>We can transfer your memories and thoughts into a cyberbrain and when you wake up, you'll be in your new cyberbody, but what about your original body? Is the continuity people experience a programmed illusion as anti-cyberization organization would want you to believe?</p>
<p>If we can transfer your thoughts and memories, can't we also make a copy? A backup of you? Can we copy you to multiple cyberbodies? Will they all still be you? Or are you you?</p>
<p>Ghost hacks are inherently more difficult than the sort most hackers are used to doing; step the difficulty up the ladder by one or two. And they are usually resisted by Will. Especially if you aren't aware that you are being hacked.</p>
<h5 id="memory">Memory</h5>
<p>Of course, some memories are more important and associated with more than one retrieval condition. Altering these memories can cause a cascade of other adjustments to become necessary. That is, if you care about the long term stability of the mind you are messing with.</p>
<h5 id="sensory-input">Sensory Input</h5>
<p>There's all kinds of things you can do with sense hacking.</p>
<h4 id="accessing-the-net">Accessing the Net</h4>
<p>An Interface implant is the most common way to access the net, but it's possible to hack the net using older generations of technology, right down to keyboard and monitor. The trick is, each step removed from full Interface is a huge reduction in your speed. Characters with the latest technology will always go first over characters stuck using older stuff, and they can invoke their advantage to interrupt slower characters.</p>
<p>There is an advantage to using older technologies because once you dip below the brain interface level, any attacks directed against you will only fry your equipment, not your brain.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keyboard or touchscreen</li>
  <li>Visual VR with voice and gesture mapping</li>
  <li>External brain electrodes</li>
  <li>Interface implant</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dummy-interface">Dummy Interface</h4>
<p>A dummy interface is a good for safe hacking. Its essentially an electronic decoy brain that will get fried instead of yours. The drawback, of course is that they are slower then direct interface. Meaning you will go after anyone with a direct interface, and the "dummy interface lag" can be invoked or compelled against you at the most inconvenient times.</p>
<p>There is also a social stigma against such prophylactics in hacking circles.</p>
<h4 id="brain-death">Brain death</h4>
<p>Hacking on the edge is as dangerous as any other profession these days. What with attack barriers threatening to sizzle your neurons and remorseless black IC trying to flat line you.</p>
<h3 id="hacking-in-play">Hacking in Play</h3>
<p>There are two way you can adjudicate a hack: as a scene that incorporates many distinct hacking actions, or as a montage which condenses all the hacking actions into one roll. There's actually nothing new about this, it's the same distinction you might make between resolving something as an <span class="fate-icon">overcome</span> or as a conflict.</p>
<p>Use a hack action by itself, or as a part of a skill challenge, when the intent is to affect a scene whose primary action is taking place in reality. Run hacking as a contest or a conflict scene when the main action is happening in the Net.</p>
<p>You can also run parallel scenes, cutting back and forth between the Net and reality. If you do, just make sure that the hacking scene has stakes that are as important as the physical action scene or your hackers are going to feel bored and marginalized. If you can have actions in one reality have consequences in the other, it will be even better.</p>
<h4 id="opposition">Opposition</h4>
<p>The opposition to any of your hacking action is just like any other action; it's either passive or active.</p>
<h5 id="active-opposition">Active Opposition</h5>
<p>You can run into active opposition in any system, even your desk calculator, if there's another hacker interfaced with it. Most people don't pay attention to their system logs of their secure net, but any good hacker will constantly monitor system activity for signs of enemy hackers. So, even if you haven't accidentally alerted the system to your presence, other interfaced hackers can roll active opposition against your hack actions. Though you will have to beat the barrier rating on the system too, if the other hacker is not that skilled.</p>
<p>Of course, humans have lapses in attention and are vulnerable to social engineering. AI constructs on the other hand, can continuously monitor a system without worrying about such human concerns.</p>
<p>Large systems like corp nets usually have human hackers continuously monitoring activity, but they also have security programs that can detect anomalous behavior and direct IC programs to take action against you. These programs can provide active opposition like a human if you are running a very detailed hack, but you can run them as just an increase in the passive opposition of a system until the hacker fails an action and puts the system on alert.</p>
<p>One of the consequences of failing a hack action is often that the system has classified your actions as suspicious and dispatches some complication like an IC program or human hacker to investigate. Failing a hack action is a great excuse to move from passive opposition to active opposition and thus increase the challenge of the rest of the run.</p>
<h5 id="passive-opposition">Passive Opposition</h5>
<p>Many systems only provide passive opposition. They just have hardening, maybe not even a barrier program or automated defense systems that can provide active opposition against an intruder. Smart devices not in use, most commercial secure nets in homes and small businesses, like restaurants, are of this sort. As are the occasional lone server you can find connected to the Net.</p>
<article class="right">
  <h4 id="hacking-example">Hacking Example</h4>
  <p><strong>Player</strong>: I'll roll to crack the system.</p>
  <p><strong>GM</strong>: What is it you want to achieve?</p>
  <p><strong>Player</strong>: I want to activate the sprinkler system in the restaurant and slow down the swarm of mosquito drones.</p>
  <p><strong>GM</strong>: ok, we'll do that as one action because the real world is the focus right now. It's a typical restaurant net so your opposition will be 2. Roll Hack.</p>
  <p><strong>Player</strong>: I got a 4!</p>
</article>
<h4 id="hacking-montage">Hacking Montage</h4>
<p>A gunfight might be over in seconds, but a hack can happen a hundred times faster because hackers aren't bound by meat rules. In fact, it's one of the things that attracts people to hacking and can make hackers a little strange to interact with in the real world. So, don't be shy about resolving even complex hacks as a single montage action, especially if the real focus of a scene is in physical reality.</p>
<p>Once you know the outcome of the montage, you can narrate the highlights of the hack such as the barriers cracked, the systems traversed and the opposition encountered.</p>
<h5 id="opposition-1">Opposition</h5>
<p>The opposition for a hacking montage is generally the highest barrier or hardening rating out of all the nodes being hacked. You can crack through multiple barrier programs in a single montage.</p>
<p>The system can present active opposition as appropriate, and many will. If there are noteworthy defenses beyond just the barrier program, give the system an aspect for those and bump up the opposition. <span class="aspect">Black IC</span>, or <span class="aspect">Hackers Watching Everything</span> for example.</p>
<h5 id="succeeding-at-a-cost">Succeeding At a Cost</h5>
<p>You can use the <span class="fate-icon"><span class="aspect">succeed at a cost</span></span> concept from <span class="fate-icon">overcome</span> actions when someone fails a hacking montage, even if they're trying to <span class="fate-icon">attack</span>.</p>
<p>The cost to succeed can be based on the qualities of the system you're hacking. For example, most serious secure nets have <span class="aspect">Black IC</span> which can inflict stress as a cost. One or two for a minor cost, and perhaps even a major consequence for a major cost.</p>
<h6 id="example-costs">Example Costs</h6>

<h4 id="hacking-sequence">Hacking Sequence</h4>
<p>If your action is set in cyberspace then you can run it is a scene. If, for example, your entire team is interfaced with the objective of cracking Chibutsu's AI Persona storage and slipping an extra command directive into their top selling personal assistant AI; that would make a great scene. If you're just trying to activate a building's fire defense system to create <span class="aspect">Big Billowing Clouds of Fire Suppressant Gas</span> that will cover your team as they escape; you'd be better served by the quick resolution of a hacking montage.</p>
<p>Hacking as scene builds on hacking as an action, and everything that's true for an action is true for a scene. After all, a scene is a sequence of actions, but when you run hacking as a scene you handle the troubles a hacker faces in a more interesting and detailed way.</p>
<p>When it comes to a scene we can turn a bunch of aspects into more detailed opposition. Black IC programs that have stats of their own. And you can fight them in the net. But, then we have the question again of what skill you use. Hack. Hack stunts will make a big difference.</p>
<h5 id="movement">Movement</h5>
<p>In a hacking scene all the action happens at Net speed. Systems and IC programs can react to you just as fast as you can react to them, so we zoom in and track movement at more detailed level.</p>
<p>Without opposition you can move freely around cyberspace. Amongst the zones of a locale by virtual "physical" movement or by transferring between accessible locales and nodes, provided they are not protected by a barrier.</p>
<p>For one opposed action in cyberspace:</p>
<p>You can move around the zones of a locale using your Move skill if you're following the rules, or your Hack skill if you are not. Moving by Hack gives you a distinct advantage because you can ignore the programmed rules of movement and do things like teleport, or move through walls.</p>
<p>Wherever you are in a system, the transfer menu is always available and if you want to get into a node or locale protected by a barrier you can roll to crack it and move to that entity.</p>
<h5 id="stress">Stress</h5>
<p>Hackers, programs, systems, these things all have stress tracks.</p>
<p>Programs get unraveled as they take stress and if they are important enough to have consequences, those will represent various bugs and malfunctions that take away parts of the programs function. This might be <span class="aspect">Lost Chunks of Data</span>, or <span class="aspect">Broken Voice Feature</span>. Programs that are taken out are completely at your mercy. You can delete the program, or capture it and rewrite it to be loyal to you.</p>
<p>Systems have stress as well, and larger corp system can take significant amounts, but, as with programs, taking out an entire system can crash it, and everything in it, irrevocably, or it could mean you get to take over the entire system.</p>
